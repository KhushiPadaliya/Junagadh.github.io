            <h1><u><b>Uparkot Fort </b></u></h1>
            <h2><u>History : </u></h2>
            <p id = "p1">A fort and town was established at the foothills of Girnar hill during reign of the Maurya Empire and continued to be used during Gupta period, but it lost its importance when the capital of Saurashtra region was moved from Junagadh to Vallabhi by Maitraka. 
                         Chudasamas settled around Junagadh from 875 CE according to bards when they acquired Vamansthali (Vanthli) from Chavda ruler.
                         A 10th-century Chudasama king Graharipu (r. c.940-c.982) cleared the old citadel free from the jungle. From the evidence contained in the Hemchandra's Dvyashraya, it can be concluded that Graharipu laid the foundations of the citadel as it now exists. 
                         the legend is told about its rediscovery.</p>
            <h2><u>Architecture :</u></h2>
                         The Uparkot is one of the most interesting of old forts. The parapets on the east, where the place is commanded by higher ground, have been raised at least three times to give cover against the increasingly long range of projectiles.
                         The entrance is beyond the town in the east wall, and consists of three gateways, one inside the other. The fort walls are from 60 to 70 feet high, forming a massive cluster of buildings. The inner gateway, a beautiful specimen of the Torana, has been topped by more later Indo-Saracenic work.
                         On the rampart above the gate is an inscription of Mandalika III, dated 1450. Near this is the Jumma Masjid built by Mahmud Begada.</p>
